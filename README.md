I faced a situation where I had to decide whether to use the useState hook or the useReducer hook in this application. Both hooks are similar in some ways, but the main difference is that useState is typically used for managing a single piece of state, while useReducer is more suitable for handling multiple or complex state updates. I preferred using useState because it is easier to implement and understand. Since the state logic in my application was not very complex, I chose useState over useReducer.
